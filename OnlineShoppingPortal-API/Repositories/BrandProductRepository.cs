     * repository pattern is for data access abstraction from the
     * rest of the application in handling database communication. 
     * 
     * A consistent interface for working with data, no matter what 
     * data storage platform used. Like a universal adapater between
     * application and data.
     * 
     * It encapsulates the data access logic so it makes testing, 
     * maintaining and changing the logic easier. 
     * 
     * ***
     * As this project is small and does not anticipate major structural
     * changes, with fixed data access, the repository patterns are not 
     * implemented fully for all models in this project. A few repositories
     * are implemented to showcase its capability.
